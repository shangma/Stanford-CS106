Standford CS Projects
=====================


>Natural Language Markov Model

This is an interesting project from the Stanford CS106 course.  It takes in an example file and "learns" it language patterns by creating an nth degree markov model on its characters.  It then mimicks its parent file by randomly generating charaters based upon this model.

>FacePamphlet

A basic social network held in memory on a local machine.  An excellent exercise in OO design.
